spdylay 0.3.0
=============

Release Note
------------

This release fixes buffer overrun when a lot of streams are created.
SPDYLAY_OPT_MAX_RECV_CTRL_FRAME_BUFFER option was added to control the
maximum payload size of the incoming control frames.

Changes
-------

* Bump up LT version to 2.0.1.

* Included <functional> from spdy.h

* Made spdylay_strerror(0) return "Success"

* Added SPDYLAY_OPT_MAX_RECV_CTRL_FRAME_BUFFER option.  This option
  sets maximum receive buffer size for incoming control frame.
  Basically the library checks the length field of the incoming
  control frame. For frames with name/value header block, the library
  also checks the length of inflated block is also under the
  limit. This is done while incrementally inflating block. If the
  length of frames with name/value header block exceeds the limit, the
  library will issue RST_STREAM with FRAME_TOO_LARGE. For other
  frames, it will issue GOAWAY.

* Incremental name/value block decompression

* Fixed buffer overrun in spdylay_pq_push
