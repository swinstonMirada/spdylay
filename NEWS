spdylay 1.2.5
=============

Release Note
------------

This release fixes the bug that write timeout in shrpx frontend
connection is triggered when there is no data to write.

Changes
-------

* shrpx: Set timeout to underlying bufferevent

  Setting write timeout to filter bufferevent does not work as
  intended.  It timeouts even when there is no data to write.



spdylay 1.2.4
=============

Release Note
------------

This release adds several new options to shrpx SPDY proxy.  NPN
selection made by spdylay_select_next_protocol() now prefers higher
SPDY version, regardless of the order of received protocol
identifiers.  Other several minor fixes were also made.

Changes
-------

* shrpx: Remove Connection: close header field from CONNECT response

* spdycat: Fix bug that -H does not allow single letter header name

* NPN: Prefer higher SPDY version

* NPN: Check protocol id length so that scanner don't overrun buffer

* spdycat: Allow -H to override built-in header fields

  This change also allow users to send specify multiple same header
  fields using -H if it is not built-in header fields.

* shrpx: Add X-Forwarded-For header field to SPDY backend request

  This change also fixes its header field in http/1 backend where
  x-forwarded-proto has http if frontend is SPDY http.

* shrpx: Add rate limit per worker thread

* Update http-parser and allow extra characters in TOKEN

  Now http-parser is updated to
  8d9e5db981b623fffc93657abacdc80270cbee58.  We allow additional
  characters in TOKEN to access somewhat *broken* servers. The all
  patches we made for spdylay are attached in this directory.



spdylay 1.2.3
=============

Release Note
------------

This release adds new options to shrpx and spdycat. Spdycat now can
speak the protocol other than TLSv1. For library side, strict header
name/value validation is done against received headers.

Changes
-------

* shrpx: Disable TLS renegotiation

* shrpx: Add --client-private-key-file and --client-cert-file options

* shrpx: Call SpdySession::disconnect() if initiate_connection() failed

  This will clean up resources allocated in initiate_connection()
  properly.

* spdycat: Fix port checking to share connection

* shrpx: Send acceptable list of CAs when client cert auth is enabled

* spdycat: Add support for SPDY proxies

  Patch from Nils "irrenhaus" Hesse

* spdycat: Use SSLv23_client_method instead of TLSv1_client_method

* shrpx: Add --tls-proto-list option to enable SSL/TLS protocol
  selectively

* Validate header name/value pair strictly to avoid possible attack

* Don't return SPDYLAY_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT if priority is larger than
  lowest



spdylay 1.2.2
=============

Release Note
------------

This release fixes the bug that shrpx exits when SPDY backend
connection cannot be established.

Changes
-------

* shrpx: Don't DIE when establishing backend SPDY connection failed

* spdylay_map: Implement hash table

* Tear down connection on invalid DATA frame reception



spdylay 1.2.1
=============

Release Note
------------

This release fixes the bug which makes shrpx crash on downstream
connection failure.

Changes
-------

* shrpx: Fix crash on downstream connection failure



spdylay 1.2.0
=============

Release Note
------------

This release adds SPDY/3.1 support and fixes flow control bug.  The
shrpx, SPDY proxy, got client certificate authentication.  It now also
supports custom HTTP-version string (e.g., ICY).  The spdycat and
spdyd got --color option to force ANSI color escape in output.

Changes
-------

* shrpx: Add options to specify per-connection window size

* Interleave streams with same priority

* Add SPDY/3.1 support

  The added feature is connection-level flow control.

* src/http-parser: Allow custom HTTP-version string (e.g., ICY)

  We need HTTP major and minor version later, so we assume it is
  HTTP/1.0 equivalent if custom HTTP-version string is used.

* src/http-parser: Update to HEAD

* shrpx: Add --verify-client-cacert option

  Using --cacert to load certificate for client certificate
  authentication is problematic since, --cacert is also used for
  client mode.  This commit adds --verify-client-cacert option which
  specify the CA certficate file used only for client certificate
  validation.  This change also removes the default certficate load
  function for client certificate validation.

* shrpx: Add --verify-client option

  This option requires client certificate and successful verification.
  Use --cacert option to add CA certificates as necessary.

* spdycat, spdyd: Add --color option to force colored log output

* shrpx: Check DATA_FLAG_FIN on on_data_recv_callback

* tests: Fix main test fail with address-sanitizer

* Fix outbound flow control count

  We wrongly added the whole payload length even if we sent part of it.

* shrpx: Fix missing extension HTTP status code in response

* shrpx: Add rate limit options

* shrpx: Replace \r\n with space when constructing HTTP/1 headers

* shrpx: Guard ecdh use with !OPENSSL_NO_EC

* spdylay_ssl: fix the user-agent position

  Patch from soyer

* spdycat: Add missing verbose output for upload DATA

* Call on_stream_close_callback for stream in SPDYLAY_STREAM_INITIAL state

  We call on_stream_close_callback even if stream->state is
  SPDYLAY_STREAM_INITIAL. This will happen while sending request
  HEADERS, a local endpoint receives RST_STREAM for that stream. It
  may be PROTOCOL_ERROR, but without notifying stream closure will
  hang the stream in a local endpoint.
